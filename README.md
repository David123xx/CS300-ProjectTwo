# CS300-ProjectTwo

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      The problem I was trying to solve was creating efficient code using algorithms and data structures. The problem required us to parse a .txt file of courses, sort and display them and allow the ability to search what the prerequisites are.
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      We approached this problem by creating pseudocode for 3 different datastructures in project 1. These are important to understand because when you look at how these individual datastructures work, they have their positives and negatives. For instance a hash table has an O(1) at best for searching, or can be O(n) at worst. There are ways to make it go down but that increases the complexity of the code. For a binary search tree, the sorting of it is easier because it is sorted when it goes into the tree, making it easier to print out the course list.
      
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      The activities were relatively easy, there were instances of starter code not being finished that caused a lot headaches but once I debugged it, it was just simply following the FIXME's. For the project... I went through 3 iterations of it. The first and second times I turned it in I decided to scrap because I was completing it while talking to a software engineer on discord that every now and then helps tutor me on concepts. After going with what he said would be better code that will show off skils, it kept breaking. Once I thought I had fixed one part of it, something else would be broken. In the end, I finally I decided to make it simple and easy and revisit the activities we did in the past, pull the data structure we already created for those activities, rewrote the parts that needed to make the program work. After doing that, it worked perfectly.
      
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      Honestly I learned a lot about "keeping it simple but functional." I also found pseudocode to be very helpful once I went back to the roots.
      
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      As an example before, I was able to adapt previous code rather than reinventing the wheel like what was suggested by my tutor/friend. I wish I hadn't wasted so much time like that before.
